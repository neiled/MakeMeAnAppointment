Every business has a calendar
Every bookable has a calendar

Every calendar has a list of non working dates (holidays etc)
Every calendar has a collection of WorkingDays [Mon-Sun]

Each WorkingDay has:
  Start Time
  End time
  Day Identifier (Mon-Sun)

The business calendar and bookable calendar work to determine what days a bookable
works.

For non working dates, the business is the basis and then the bookable can add to
the list of dates. For example if the business is closed over xmas than that will
affect all bookables. However a bookables holiday will only affect that bookable.

For what times worked during the week the days worked and the start time and end
time are defaulted to the business calendar. However, if a bookable doesn't have an
entry for a paricular day then they are not available for appointments for that day.
For example, ususally the business is open Mon-Fri so there are entries for Mon-Fri
in the business calendar, however one worker doesn't work wednesdays so they don't
have an entry for the wednesday.
If a bookable has a null start time or end time that means it defaults to the
businesses start time or end time.
If the bookable has breaks when they are unavailable during a day, then this would
be recorded as a workday entry where the start time would be the start of the period
before the break and the end time would be the time the break starts. They would
then have a second workday entry for the same day with a different start and end
time, starting when the break ends and ending when the end of the day finishes or
when the second break starts.
